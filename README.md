# CloudFormationCs
AWS CloudFormation template builder library for CSharp

## Features

- Quick access to relevant online documentation.
- Code completion only shows relevant properties for a particular object type.
- Eliminates typos - your templates are built by a compiler before being uploaded.
- Use method calls to reduce large amounts of repeated code in your templates.
- Use C# regions to make large templates easier to work on.
- Put lots of comments in your templates (they won't carry over to JSON, but you probably won't be looking anyways).
- Where in my all templates am I using t1.micros? "Find references" in favorite C# IDE will show you.
- Compiler generates warnings if your templates are using old generation instance types.
- Works in Visual Studio and MonoDevelop
- Works in Linux
- Makes writing templates a breeze!
